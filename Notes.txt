# JSX
- JSX is NOT html in JS. It is HTML like syntax.

# Component composition
- Merge multiple components into one component.

# Config Driven UI
- The UI is driven by the configs (data).

# How React works behind the scenes
- React uses reconciliation algorithm to update the DOM. (React DOM)
- React finds diffrence between virtual DOMs and updates only the changed part of the DOM.

# Higher Order Components
- A higher-order component (HOC) means, a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

# Pure Components
- A pure component is a component that does not re-render if the state and props are not changed.

# Controlled Components
- A controlled component is a component that does not have its own state. It is controlled by the parent component.

# Uncontrolled Components
- An uncontrolled component is a component that has its own state.

# Props drilling
- Passing props from parent to child to child to child and so on.

# Context
- Context is used to avoid props drilling.
- createContext = createContext(defaultValue)
- useContext = useContext(context)
- Provider = Wrap context.Provider to the parent component (functional) and pass value prop to it for providing the value to the children.
- Consumer = Wrap context.Consumer in class based components to use context value.
- contextType = Use contextType to consume the value in class components.
